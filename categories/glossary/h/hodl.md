## HODL
2,100 sats

HODL is an adage native to the Bitcoin community, derived simply from a misspelling of the word “hold”. It advises bitcoiners to remain stoic and avoid selling in the face of the extreme price volatility Bitcoin often experiences. Bitcoiners believe bitcoin to be the future global reserve asset, and thus, its gains should be astronomical, even relative to current prices. Thus, while trading could potentially offer short term gains, hodling is the safer alternative in that a hodler can never find themself with fewer bitcoin than they started with. The term HODL finds its origins in a post on the BitcoinTalk forum from an inebriated bitcoiner during a price crash.
