|<a id="asic"></a>ASIC (特定用途向け集積回路)|Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) |An Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) is a special microchip built for exactly one purpose. Bitcoin ASIC miners, the hardware devices that contain these chips, are designed solely to hash blocks in order to find a valid Proof-of-Work. Essentially, the only function these microchips perform is the SHA-256 hash function on a block header. Because mining has become such a large industry, the difficulty has risen to the point where using a CPU or GPU to mine is no longer profitable. Having a single purpose affords ASIC miners critical efficiency gains in an industry where the tiniest efficiency improvement can give a miner the edge. The rapid innovation around Bitcoin ASICs has partially driven the explosion of hash rate over the last decade, bolstering Bitcoin’s security. |  2,100 sats  |
|<a id="51_attack"></a>51%攻撃| 51% Attack | If an attacker wishes to alter a block in the Bitcoin blockchain, they must recreate the Proof-of-Work, not only for the block they wish to change, but for all subsequent blocks as well. In addition, they must also produce new blocks faster than all honest miners combined in order to convince nodes that their altered chain is valid. This is due to the fact that nodes always consider the longest chain—the chain with the most blocks—to be the valid chain. To achieve all of this, the malicious miner must control 51% of the mining power of the Bitcoin network. In other words, they must have more computing power than all other miners combined. The difficulty of this attack makes Bitcoin secure against fraud and transaction reversals. Fear of a 51% attack is also why measuring hash rate is so important. Hash rate is a measure of the total mining capacity of the Bitcoin network, and the higher this number, the more expensive a 51% attack is. Hash rate is thus a measure of security against a 51% attack.|  2,100 sats  |
|<a id="bip125"></a>BIP 125 (RBF)|BIP 125 (Replace-by-Fee) |Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 125 introduces Replace-by-Fee (RBF) to Bitcoin. This soft fork enables users to replace an unconfirmed transaction with a similar transaction paying a larger fee. Some Bitcoin wallets, such as Electrum, now allow users to use RBF. When a transaction is broadcast, it pays a defined fee to the miner of that transaction. If the fee is too low, miners will defer mining that transaction in favor of other transactions which paid higher fees. In order to speed up a transaction’s confirmation, a user can take advantage of RBF to increase the fee of their transaction. Nodes following BIP 125 will accept the new transaction and remove the older version from their mempool. Before BIP 125, Bitcoin nodes would automatically reject a transaction which attempted to spend UTXOs already spent in a different transaction in their mempool. BIP 125 created a caveat to that rule. However, a transaction must opt into RBF in its first version to make RBF possible. This is done using the sequence, a previously unused field of a transaction input. |  2,100 sats  |
|<a id="bip174"></a>BIP 174 (PSBT)|BIP 174 (PSBT) |Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 174 introduced Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT) as a community standard. PSBT is a standardized format for communicating unsigned or partially signed Bitcoin transactions. PSBT was originally designed to enhance interoperability between wallets and other Bitcoin software, making it easier for a transaction to be constructed by one wallet, transferred to another for signing, and then transferred to a Bitcoin node for broadcasting. PSBT is also particularly useful for coordinating between parties who wish to sign the same transaction. For example, CoinJoin protocols and multisig outputs require multiple different actors to all sign the same transaction. The PSBT format provides a method for constructing the transaction, passing it between the different signers, and then assembling the final transaction to be broadcast. BIP 174 is currently widely adopted as a community standard, however it has several downsides, which are currently being addressed by a proposal for PSBT v2. |  2,100 sats  |
|<a id="bip32"></a>BIP 32 (階層型決定性ウォレット)|BIP 32 (Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets) |BIP 32 is the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal which introduced the standard of Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets and extended keys to Bitcoin. BIP 32 was a significant improvement for Bitcoin wallets in several ways. First, HD wallets greatly improved the interoperability of wallets, as a set of keys could be transferred between wallet software with a single extended private key (xprv). Likewise, the recoverability of wallets was improved, as a single seed could recover the entire wallet. This improvement was extended with BIP 39, which made seeds easier to store and remember. Lastly, BIP 32 enabled watch-only wallets, which can store and generate new addresses, allowing the user to receive payments and check their balances without ever needing to use private keys. Watch-only wallets enhance a user’s security by allowing them to keep their private keys in cold storage, while continuing to receive bitcoin, track balances, and craft transactions. |  2,100 sats  |
|<a id="bip39"></a>BIP 39 (ニモニックフレーズ)|BIP 39 (Mnemonic Phrases) |BIP 39 is the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal which introduced the standard of mnemonic phrases. Mnemonic phrases offer a standardized method for converting a seed into a series of 12-24 words. Thus, a mnemonic phrase is all that is needed to recover all private keys of a wallet. While BIP 39’s standard has been adopted by almost all popular Bitcoin wallets, it was never implemented into Bitcoin Core, and does have a few engineering drawbacks. However, there are no known security weaknesses to mnemonic phrases, and they serve as a convenient way to backup Bitcoin wallets. |  2,100 sats  |
|<a id="btc"></a>BTC|BTC |BTC is the ticker symbol for Bitcoin. One bitcoin is denoted as 1 BTC, just as one U.S. dollar is denoted as 1 USD or one share of Apple Inc. is denoted by 1 AAPL. One BTC is divisible into 100,000,000 units, called satoshis or sats. |  2,100 sats  |
|<a id="dex"></a>DEX (分散型取引所)|Decentralized Exchange (DEX) |A decentralized exchange (DEX) is meant to facilitate the exchange of bitcoin without forcing users to sacrifice privacy or custody to an exchange. DEXs offer access to their exchange without Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures, meaning they do not collect a user’s government-issued ID, address, or phone number. Decentralized exchanges vary in the full extent of their decentralization; some are simply non-custodial, but maintain a central authority to arbitrate disputes while others are fully decentralized protocols. Most DEXs also execute bitcoin trades directly between users without taking control of the bitcoin as middlemen. Often, decentralized exchanges will require the bitcoin seller to deposit bitcoin into a 2-of-3 multisig address, where each party - the buyer, the seller, and the DEX, holds a key. When the seller receives payment, the buyer and seller then co-sign a transaction sending the bitcoin from the multisig address to the seller’s address. If either party breaches the agreement, the aggreived party can appeal to the DEX, who can use their key to resolve the dispute. |  2,100 sats  |
|<a id="ecdsa"></a>ECDSA|ECDSA |The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm or ECDSA is a cryptographic scheme for producing digital signatures using public and private keys. All Bitcoin keys and signatures are currently generated using ECDSA. An ECDSA signature allows someone to publish a public key and then create a signature of some data with their private key, such that anyone can verify that the signature was created by the owner of this public key. However, no one is capable of deriving the private key from the public key or the signature. Nor can this signature be used to forge a signature for other data. ECDSA signatures are used to sign all Bitcoin transactions thanks to these strong security features. An elliptic curve is a defined mathematical function of the general format y^2 = x^3 + ax + b. For Bitcoin, this curve has the specific equation y^2 = x^3 + 7, as a = 0 and b = 7. Any point on this elliptic curve, called secp256k1, is a valid Bitcoin public key. In order to generate a public key, a user must generate a private key, which is simply a large number. Next, this private key is multiplied by a defined point called the Generator Point, to produce the public key. This multiplication is point multiplication, which behaves differently than normal multiplication. Critically, point division is incalculable, meaning a public key cannot currently be used to derive a private key, giving the ECDSA scheme its security. |  2,100 sats  |
|<a id="htlc"></a>HTLC (ハッシュタイムロックコントラクト)|Hashed Time Locked Contract (HTLC) |A Time Locked Contract is a Bitcoin transaction which includes a timelock. This Bitcoin transaction is hashed to form a Hashed Time Locked Contract or HTLC, which is used mainly on the Lightning Network to allow Lightning payments to be routed across multiple nodes. Lightning routing allows two parties to trustlessly transact without a direct channel between them, using intermediary channels instead. |  2,100 sats  |
|<a id="hodl"></a>HODL| HODL|HODL is an adage native to the Bitcoin community, derived simply from a misspelling of the word “hold”. It advises bitcoiners to remain stoic and avoid selling in the face of the extreme price volatility Bitcoin often experiences. Bitcoiners believe bitcoin to be the future global reserve asset, and thus, its gains should be astronomical, even relative to current prices. Thus, while trading could potentially offer short term gains, hodling is the safer alternative in that a hodler can never find themself with fewer bitcoin than they started with. The term HODL finds its origins in a post on the BitcoinTalk forum from an inebriated bitcoiner during a price crash. |  2,100 sats  |
|<a id="rbf"></a>RBF (Replace-By-Fee)|Replace-By-Fee (RBF) |In Bitcoin, RBF stands for Replace-by-Fee. A Bitcoin transaction can be designated as RBF in order to allow the sender to replace this transaction with another similar transaction which pays a higher fee. This mechanism exists to allow users to respond if the network becomes congested and fees rise unexpectedly. If a user sends a transaction with a low fee, and finds that it is taking too long to confirm, the user can raise the fee they pay to confirm their transaction faster. RBF only works while the transaction is in the mempool. As soon as a transaction enters a block, it cannot be replaced by fee. Additionally, when a transaction is first sent, it must specify that it is available to be replaced by fee. This is achieved by setting the nSequence, a small part of each transaction, to any value below 0xfffffffe. The nSequence of a transaction is intended to allow a transaction to be updated after it has been broadcast. Also see [BIP 125 (RBF)](#pbip125)|  -  |
|<a id="uasf"></a>UASF|User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF) |A User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF) is an update or change to the Bitcoin network’s protocol initiated by users or nodes, who integrate new code into their Bitcoin implementations and demonstrate their acceptance of the change so that miners and other users can implement the same changes knowing they will maintain consensus. Since the update is a soft fork, updating is not required because the changes to the protocol are backwards compatible. If a node does not update, they are not harmed at all.|  2,100 sats  |
|<a id="utxo"></a>UTXO (未使用トランザクションアウトプット)|Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) |An Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) is a discrete piece of bitcoin. Bitcoin does not use accounts and balances. Instead, individual pieces of bitcoin are owned by individuals. Each UTXO has an amount associated with it. These are the discrete units of bitcoin which are spent and received in every transaction. When a UTXO is spent in a transaction it is destroyed, and one or more new UTXOs are created. All nodes maintain a set of existing UTXOs, called the UTXO set, which they update every time a block of transactions creates and destroys UTXOs. This allows nodes to independently verify whether a given transaction and the bitcoin it is attempting to spend are valid. UTXOs are analogous to physical cash in that they usually require change when spent. If Alice owns a UTXO worth 1 BTC and wishes to pay Bob 0.4 BTC, she must spend the entire 1 BTC as an input. In order to send Bob exactly 0.4 BTC, Alice creates two outputs: the first to Bob, in the amount of 0.4 BTC, and the second back to herself, in the amount 0.59 BTC, assuming that she paid a 0.01 BTC transaction fee. This transaction will consume one UTXO and create 2 new ones. Note that the fee paid is not itself an output. It is implied by the sum of the inputs—1 BTC—minus the sum of the outputs—0.4 + 0.59 = 0.99 BTC. The miner of this transaction would calculate this fee and claim it for themself in the coinbase transaction. |  2,100 sats  |
|<a id="utxo_set"></a>UTXOセット| UTXO Set|The UTXO set is the comprehensive set of all UTXOs existing at a given point in time. The sum of the amounts of each UTXO in this set is the total supply of existing bitcoin at that point of time. Bitcoin is special as a money in that anyone can verify the total supply at any time in a trustless manner. All nodes maintain identical copies of the UTXO set. When a new block is created, the UTXO set is updated as some UTXOs were spent and new ones were created. The UTXO set is also important because it allows all nodes in the Bitcoin network to detect and reject attempted double spends, wherein someone attempts to spend the same bitcoin twice. Nodes must store the entire UTXO at all times in order to determine which bitcoin exist, and thus can be spent, at any given point in time.|  2,100 sats  |
|<a id="vbyte"></a>vByte|vByte |A vByte is a unit of measure for the weight of blocks and transactions. The vByte was introduced by the SegWit upgrade. A vByte is equivalent to 4 weight units, and thus, a block is limited to being 1 vMegabyte large, or 4 million weight units. Wallets usually calculate and display transaction fees in terms of sats/vByte, meaning the fee is paid per vByte of data used. Thus, the larger the transaction, the larger the total fee must be to ensure the desired speed of verification. This setup also makes SegWit transactions cheaper than regular transactions, as a byte of Witness data is only equivalent to 1 weight unit (1/4 vByte), while a byte of non-Witness data is 4 weight units (1 vByte). |  2,100 sats  |
