## Smart Contract
2,100 sats

A smart contract is a digitally created and enforced contract. As with regular contracts, these contracts can become as complex as the language in which they are written allows. Bitcoin’s contract language, called Script, is intentionally limited, giving Bitcoin security and simplicity. However, other layers or applications built on top of Bitcoin make use of more complex smart contracts. Smart contracts can be used to design loans, timelocked transactions, and even derivative products.
