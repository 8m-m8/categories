## Stock-to-Flow (S2F)
2,100 sats

Stock-to-flow (S2F) is a measure of the new supply of an asset that is being created over time, relative to the existing supply. This ratio can be expressed in several ways, including the percentage of the supply being added annually, or the number of years the supply would take to double at the current rate of production. Stock-to-flow is a commonly cited metric in Bitcoin markets. Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow will continue decreasing indefinitely as the supply increases, and the Bitcoin halving lowers the rate of production in a stepwise fashion every four years. Currently, Bitcoin has a similar stock-to-flow ratio to gold. However, Bitcoin’s ratio will decline continuously in the coming years, whereas gold’s will not. Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow ratio is also much more predictable and precisely auditable at any point in time.
