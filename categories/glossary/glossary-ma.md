|<a id="mining"></a>マイニング|Mining|Mining is the process of building the blockchain by adding new blocks one at a time. First, miners build a block by collecting many unconfirmed transactions from the mempool. This is a relatively simple step. Next, miners search for a Proof-of-Work, or a valid hash of a block. This search is essentially an energy-intensive guessing game. Once a miner has found a valid hash, they submit the block to the network. New bitcoin are minted through the process of mining as compensation for the intensive work of finding a valid hash. This new bitcoin is called the mining subsidy, and it helps miners pay the cost of finding a valid Proof-of-Work, which requires immense energy expenditure. Miners have no better way to produce a valid hash than by guessing and checking the validity of each hash, and so they attempt to make as many guesses as possible while using as little time and energy as possible. The rate at which miners guess is called their hash rate, measured in hashes per second. The cumulative hash rate of all Bitcoin miners is an important metric for determining Bitcoin’s security, as it indicates how much hash rate an attacker would need in order to execute a 51% attack. Bitcoin mining is called mining because the cost of creating new bitcoin is roughly equal to the cost of buying an existing bitcoin on the market. This process is called mining because, like gold mining, the cost of mining new bitcoin is roughly equal to the cost of a bitcoin. In other words, no one is able to print free money in bitcoin. | 2,100 sats |
|<a id="mining_pool"></a>マイニングプール| Mining Pool|The mining industry has several economies of scale, due to energy costs, capital costs, regulatory capture, and intricacies of Proof-of-Work. Thus, miners pool their resources and split the rewards. Mining pools allow smaller miners to smooth their returns and lower their risk instead of mining for very rare, exorbitant returns. When a member of a pool finds a valid block, they split the rewards with the rest of the pool based on each member’s hashrate contribution. Operators of mining pools typically collect a fee for their coordination services. | 2,100 sats |
|<a id="block_reward"></a>マイニング報酬| Block Reward |The block reward is a combination of the block subsidy and all transaction fees paid by transactions in a specific block. When miners mine a block, they receive a block subsidy in the form of newly minted bitcoin. All transactions also include a fee, which miners collect. The block reward is the sum of these two amounts. As block subsidies are cut in half every four years, fees will slowly become a greater portion of the block reward. The term block reward and block subsidy are occasionally used interchangeably. The block reward is paid out in the coinbase transaction of each block. This special transaction is the first transaction in every block, and it has no inputs. The output of a coinbase transaction cannot be spent for 100 blocks, so miners can only spend their block reward after a 100 block cooldown. | 2,100 sats |
|<a id="malleability"></a>マリアビリティ|  Malleability | Transaction malleability is the ability of a transaction to have multiple valid IDs (txids). Malleability occurs when a part of a transaction can change after the transaction has been signed without invalidating the signature. Since a txid is a hash of the transaction, any change to the transaction will result in a change of the txid. However, changes that alter the txid and invalidate the signature are not a concern; only changes which alter the txid and do not invalidate the signature raise malleability concerns. Malleability is a problem for developers and users who want to reference a previous transaction in a spending transaction before the previous transaction has been confirmed on the blockchain. This problem arises because, in order to spend an output created by a previous transaction, the spending transaction must reference the txid of the previous transaction. If this txid can change, the reference will fail, and the spending transaction will be rendered invalid. A transaction can be malleated in two ways. First, after being signed, additional data can be added to a ScriptSig. Secondly, the signature itself, which is contained within the ScriptSig, can be changed. These options are both possible because a signature cannot sign itself.Eliminating transaction malleability was achieved by the SegWit upgrade, enabling more innovation on top of Bitcoin, including the Lightning Network and Taproot. SegWit eliminated transaction malleability by moving the ScriptSig—the transaction signature and the malleable part of the transaction—from the main body of the transaction into a separate Witness section.| 2,100 sats |
|<a id="multisig"></a>マルチシグ| Multisig |A standard bitcoin transaction sends bitcoin to an address. This bitcoin can then be spent by the private key to which it belongs. However, bitcoin can also be sent such that it requires multiple signatures from different private keys. In this way, funds can be jointly held by a family, business partners, corporate boards, or any collective. Multisig setups are typically described as m-of-n, wherein the signatures of at least m private keys are required, and these private keys must correspond to any of the n defined public keys. For example, in a typical “2-of-3” setup, three public keys will be defined, and signatures from any two of the corresponding private keys are sufficient to unlock and spend the bitcoin. Most multisig transactions are executed as P2SH transactions, so the address will begin with a “3”. In these cases, the exact script determining which keys are required is not exposed to the blockchain until the bitcoin has been spent. This means that the receivers of the bitcoin, those whose keys formed the multisig address, must remember the setup in order to spend the bitcoin. This setup is called the RedeemScript, as it allows the bitcoin to be redeemed and spent. Let’s walk through an example: Alice, Bob, and Charlie want to start a company and hold joint custody of some bitcoin. To ensure that one of them cannot steal the collective funds, Alice, Bob, and Charlie share one public key each. They also decide that they will run their company based on majority rule. Thus, any two signatures are sufficient to spend their shared bitcoin. This requirement of two signatures coming from any of the three public keys, is translated to form a script, which is hashed to yield the address to which all three partners will send their contributions to the company fund. This set up would be described as a 2-of-3 multisig. | 2,100 sats |
|<a id="mixing"></a>ミキシング|Mixing|A mixing service, sometimes called a mixer or a tumbler, accepts bitcoin deposits and sends different pieces of bitcoin back to the user in the same amount. When done properly, this effectively obscures ownership of the bitcoin and allows users to privatize their bitcoin. Mixing services have run into legal disputes and several have been shut down and charged with money laundering. This is because mixing services, unlike CoinJoin services, take custody of user funds. | 2,100 sats |
|<a id="utxo"></a>未使用トランザクションアウトプット（UTXO）|  UTXO | An Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) is a discrete piece of bitcoin. Bitcoin does not use accounts and balances. Instead, individual pieces of bitcoin are owned by individuals. Each UTXO has an amount associated with it. These are the discrete units of bitcoin which are spent and received in every transaction. When a UTXO is spent in a transaction it is destroyed, and one or more new UTXOs are created. All nodes maintain a set of existing UTXOs, called the UTXO set, which they update every time a block of transactions creates and destroys UTXOs. This allows nodes to independently verify whether a given transaction and the bitcoin it is attempting to spend are valid.　UTXOs are analogous to physical cash in that they usually require change when spent. If Alice owns a UTXO worth 1 BTC and wishes to pay Bob 0.4 BTC, she must spend the entire 1 BTC as an input. In order to send Bob exactly 0.4 BTC, Alice creates two outputs: the first to Bob, in the amount of 0.4 BTC, and the second back to herself, in the amount 0.59 BTC, assuming that she paid a 0.01 BTC transaction fee. This transaction will consume one UTXO and create 2 new ones. Note that the fee paid is not itself an output. It is implied by the sum of the inputs—1 BTC—minus the sum of the outputs—0.4 + 0.59 = 0.99 BTC. The miner of this transaction would calculate this fee and claim it for themself in the coinbase transaction.|  2,100 sats  |
|<a id="mempool"></a>メンプール（メモリープール）| Mempool|The mempool (memory pool) is a smaller database of unconfirmed or pending transactions which every node keeps. When a transaction is confirmed by being included in a block, it is removed from the mempool. Nodes share mempool data by relaying signed transactions to each other, but there is no single mempool and few if any nodes keep the entire mempool. Miners draw transactions from the mempool to include in their blocks. | 2,100 sats |
