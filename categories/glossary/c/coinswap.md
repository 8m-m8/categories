## CoinSwap
2,100 sats

CoinSwap is a proposed method for making Bitcoin transactions more private. Currently, chain analysis relies heavily on the assumption that if Alice sends an entire UTXO to an address, she is sending the transaction to herself. CoinSwap undermines this assumption by allowing two parties to send entire UTXOs to new addresses which are not their own. In doing so, parties will swap UTXOs and break the chain of custody for both coins.
While a CoinSwap is composed of on-chain transactions, CoinSwap is an off-chain coordination protocol, and it would not require any changes to Bitcoin’s protocol. All interactions between the two parties would take place over the internet, and normal Bitcoin transactions would be posted to the Bitcoin blockchain. However, CoinSwap is still in its nascent phase, and has not been widely implemented or adopted.
