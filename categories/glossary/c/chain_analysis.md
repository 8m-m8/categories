## Chain Analysis
2,100 sats

Chain analysis uses heuristics to analyse the blockchain and trace the ownership of bitcoin across transactions. Several companies exist solely to track and deanonymize individuals and their bitcoin using these heuristics. These companies sell their analysis to financial institutions and governments who are attempting to prevent fraud, money laundering, and other illegal activities. Chain analysis is a broad term, and should not be confused with the company called Chainalysis.
